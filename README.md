Telegram Bot: Campus Building and Dormitory Locator

This is a Telegram bot designed to help users locate buildings and dormitories on a university campus. The bot provides an interactive interface where users can request their current location, search for specific buildings, or filter dormitories by category (male or female). The bot uses inline keyboards and Google Maps links to make navigation easy and intuitive.
Features

    Current Location: Users can share their current location, and the bot will generate a Google Maps link for their coordinates.

    Find Buildings: Users can search for specific buildings on campus. The bot provides a list of buildings with direct links to their locations on Google Maps.

    Dormitory Search: Users can filter dormitories by category (male or female) and get direct links to their locations on Google Maps.

    Interactive Interface: The bot uses inline keyboards and buttons for a seamless user experience.

    Dormitory Search: Users can filter dormitories by category (male or female) and select a specific dormitory to get its location on Google Maps.

    Building Search: Users can select a building from the list and get its location on Google Maps.
